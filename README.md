# rotavirus-database-analysis

Rotavirus is the main etiologic agent of acute diarrhea in children. It is estimated that at
year the infection by these viruses causes around 128,500 deaths worldwide, being
developing countries are the most affected (Araki et al., 2018; Esparza et al., 2018;
Papa et al., 2021; Troeger et al., 2018). Rotavirus has eleven RNA gene segments,
which show great variability. This genetic variability is generated
mainly by three factors during the virus replication processes; 1) the
accumulation of mutations due to lack of RNA proofreading activity
viral polymerase, 2) the combination of genes from different strains with variations in their genes
cognate and 3) the processes of recombination of the genome (Sadiq et al., 2019; LÃ³pez & Arias,
2020; Sun et al., 2021). This has been the basis for the generation of different genotypes.
of each of the rotavirus segments circulating around the world.
